**Groundwater Availability Prediction**
-----------------------------------------
**Problem statement**

Most Indian districtsâ€™ groundwater is depleted, contaminated or both. This project aims to predict groundwater availability for a few states/union territory and encourage its sustainable use and appropriate resource planning.
_________________________________________
**Outcomes**
- Built a linear regression model using different algorithms based on factors like monsoon recharge and non-monsoon recharge. 
- Optimized model performance and increased model performance to >90%. 
- Published a comprehensive story with 2 dashboards that show key insights regarding groundwater availability, recharge and extraction, on Tableau Public. 
- Tools Used: Python (Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Tableau, Jupyter Notebook.
